# Migration Guide - V5 to V6

The main differences between V5 and V6 are:
  - The format of the frameworks: the frameworks are in `.xcframework` rather than `.framework`.
  - The way how the frameworks are distributed: besides manual integration, the frameworks can now be integrated via Cocoapods and Swift Package Manager.

- Remove the existing imported `Moneytree*.framework`s.
- Add the new `.xcframework`s - see the [Getting the SDK](../../README.md#getting-the-sdk) section of the Integration Guide.

## Required: [Configure Universal Links to support Login and Navigation features](../../README.md#configuring-universal-links-for-navigation)

Users can now login and navigate to account settings after receiving a Magic Link in their email. This must be configured in your application delegate. Please review and implement [this section of the integration guide](../../README.md#configuring-universal-links-for-navigation).  

## Optional: Upgrading to LINK Kit from Issho Tsucho

If you use Issho Tsucho, please upgrade to LINK Kit.

Remove `MoneytreeIsshoTsucho.framework`. Instead, use `MoneytreeLINKKit.xcframework`. Again, see the [Getting the SDK](../../README.md#getting-the-sdk) section of the Integration Guide.
