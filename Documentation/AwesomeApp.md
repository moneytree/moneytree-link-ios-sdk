# Using AwesomeApp

***AwesomeApp*** is a reference app created to showcase the SDK's capabilities. It is there to help you understand the SDK's base use cases. Feel free to edit it as you please.

The most relevant code samples for your implementation can be found in the `AppDelegate` and also in the sections marked `Moneytree LINK SDK` in each ViewController.

## SDK configuration in the AwesomeApp

First, configure AwesomeApp's `Info.plist` to use your client ID. Please see [Configuring your project](../README.md#configuring-your-project) for details. 

The Moneytree Link SDK is configured in `AppDelegate.swift` in `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`. 

You can edit the configuration to change the settings that match your use case.

> :information_source: This is **NOT** part of the SDK's spec, just an example of how to implement it in AwesomeApp. You can implement the configuration of the SDK in any way you prefer.

You should now be able to test a sample integration with AwesomeApp.
